# Questions

An AI system that answers questions. The question answering system consists of two tasks: document retrieval and passage retrieval.

The system is provided with a collection of text documents. When given a query (a question asked by the user), the document retrieval task identifies the most 

relevant document(s) related to the query. Once the top documents are identified, the system subdivides them into passages (sentences) to determine the most relevant

passage to the question.

Inside of the questions directory, run <code> pip3 install -r requirements.txt </code>  to install this projectâ€™s dependency: nltk for natural language processing.
